TO DO:

- [ ]  Make checkpoints.
- [ ]  Add text rendering functionality. (Maybe with FreeType?) 
- [ ]  Add a pause menu. 
- [ ]  Tune enemies a bit more.
- [ ]  Improve the collision detection algorithms so that we don't wind up with S class lag later on.
- [ ]  Once collision detection is improved, make aura deflect enemy bullets.
- [ ]  Write a triangulation algorithm that finds Walls[] and and CurveStriaghtPartition from Centers[].
- [ ]  Add more monster types!! I have some ideas written down below.
- [ ]  Work on the code for the enemies so that they don't do the jiggly thing that they do every once and a while.
- [ ]  Work on aesthetics. Maybe add alien-looking plants on the walls or something. 

Gameplay Ideas (Feel free to add more. This is mostly brainstorming.):

- [ ] As you kill monsters, you gain EXP, which you can use to buy "charms." These sacrifice one thing in exchange for another, like increase suceptability to minor damage in exchange for increasing max spin speed.

- [ ] Add some sort of story. What is your glowy ball of light character supposed to be? It should be easier to empathise with. 

Monster Ideas (Feel free to add more. This is mostly brainstorming.):

- [ ]  Ember Mote:  A small and weak monster that surrounds itself with fire every few seconds. They attack in swarms. 


- [x]  Fungal Mote:  A monster with stalks and spores on the stalks that shoot off at you as it rotates and then grow back.


- [ ]  Barbtongue: A leech like thing that sprays out bubbles in all directions that sit like mines and do minor damage when you bump into them. It then shoots out a harpoon out of its mouth that sticks into you and it drags you through the bubble minefield, doing severe damage.
